# Calinski-Harabasz (FGMachine)

## Introduction

The Calinski-Harabasz criterion is a heuristic for comparing clustering solutions on the same data [1]. Without delving into the details or assumptions of either the clustering algorithms or the Calinkski-Harabasz criterion itself, this example will simply calculate the best solution found for the Iris flower dataset [2] by using grid search. The algorithms that will be compared are *k*-means clustering, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models. The number of clusters, *k*, will vary from 1-6.

## Instructions

This example requires [MATLAB](http://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab/), and has been adapted from [Evaluate clustering solutions - MATLAB evalclusters](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/stats/evalclusters.html). The `matlab` binary must be available on [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable\)).The [JSONlab](http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?jsonlab) library should be available on [startup](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html).

1. Set up [FGLab](https://github.com/Kaixhin/FGLab/blob/master/examples/Calinski-Harabasz).
1. Insert the [project](https://github.com/Kaixhin/FGLab/blob/master/examples/Calinski-Harabasz/projects.json) into FGMachine's `project.json` file, using the project ID from FGLab.
1. Start [grid search](https://github.com/Kaixhin/FGLab/blob/master/examples/Calinski-Harabasz).

Notice that since the `capacity` has been sent to 0.1, only 10 experiments will run at one time.

## Results

The following are the results of running the code on MATLAB R2015b - your results may vary, but the trends should remain: The ideal number of clusters is 3, and Gaussian mixture models perform poorly on this dataset.
